A decade later, NSNS transformed into Northeastern State Teacher\u2019s College, offering a four-year curriculum leading to a bachelor\u2019s degree. The Oklahoma legislature authorized changing the name of NSTC to Northeastern State College in 1939. We became officially known as Northeastern State University in 1985.", "logo_small": "", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/"}
