The founders aimed to establish four principles of autonomy: freedom to select teaching staff, admission available to all students (but with a limited number), freedom to create its own study plans and freedom to administrate the University's capital. It is therefore a young university, but in its short history it has moved forward at a rapid pace demonstrating its commitment with society and contributing in two main areas: knowledge and innovation.  Furthermore, the UAB is among the best higher education institution in Spain and the European Union in terms of the quality of teaching and research. The UAB offers a wide range of courses, with 75 undergraduate courses, 73 doctoral programs, 123 postgraduate programs and 151 specialization courses. \r\nUAB at a glance: 30,406 undergraduate students, 4,657 graduates (2006-07), 12,426 postgraduate and continuing education students, 3,431 teaching and research staff and 2,504 administration and services staff.", "logo_small": "logos/UAB150dpi_ef8c12b007cdb2f72effbd172c5dba9b.jpg", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/logos/UAB150dpi_ef8c12b007cdb2f72effbd172c5dba9b.jpg"}
