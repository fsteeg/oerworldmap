OER Africa has been established to play a leading role in driving the development and use of Open Educational Resources (OER) on the African continent. \r\n\r\nOER Africa's mission is to establish vibrant networks of African OER practitioners by connecting like-minded academics from across the continent to develop, share, and adapt OER to meet the higher education needs of African societies. By creating and sustaining human networks of collaboration\u201a face-to-face and online OER Africa will enable African academics to harness the power of OER, develop their capacity, and become integrated into the emerging global OER networks as active participants rather than passive consumers.", "logo_small": "logos/OER_logo_07e19dc70ad82304747848581a6bcaf1.jpg", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/logos/OER_logo_07e19dc70ad82304747848581a6bcaf1.jpg"}
