The University of Valencia is open to practically all branches of knowledge, research and culture, and is currently one of Spain's oldest, largest and most multi-disciplined universities. In order to achieve this, the University works intensely on the quality of teaching, research and services, social involvement, the development and promotion of culture, the democratic participation of students in University life, the development of a spirit of criticism and the defense of the rights of our people, both individually and as a group.", "logo_small": "logos/Escudo05_392c2a1915956c766055ba733723118a.gif", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/logos/Escudo05_392c2a1915956c766055ba733723118a.gif"}
