In 1913, the university was founded by three Jesuit priests, in response to a request from the Roman Pontiff to open the first Catholic university in Japan. The Japanese name of this university refers to a Greek word for the highest form of wisdom, \"Sophia.\" The word Jochi comes from the Japanese translation of one of the petitions contained in a traditional Catholic prayer: the litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The phrase \"Seat of Wisdom (Jochi no za)\" appears in this litany.\r\nWe are aiming for producing graduates who can contribute to others and society, as well as their own benefit.", "logo_small": "", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/"}
