This was the birth of modern-style education in China and also the founding of NCU.\r\n\r\nNCU was re-established in Taiwan in 1962 as part of the country\u00b4s response to the International Geophysical Year. The school was initially located in Miaoli, but was relocated to Jhongli in 1968, and gradually developed into a comprehensive university. NCU has now become Taiwan\u00b4s leading school in the fields of geophysics and space science, and was selected as one of the major research-oriented universities in 2001. It is a first-rate university with solid international qualifications.\r\n\r\nNCU now has seven colleges in different areas, including College of Liberal Arts, College of Science, College of Engineering, College of Management, College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, College of Earth Sciences, and College of Hakka Studies. Its facilities and faculty are tremendously improved, and it has gained an international reputation for research and academic excellence. Cooperative education programs and cooperative research projects have grown in number over the years.\r\nIn the future, NCU will continue to apply the down-to-earth attitude and vigorous spirit to leading-edge research and innovative learning, pursuing our excellence as a first-rate university in Taiwan.", "logo_small": "logos/NCU_cd70d4f353eb9449f4ef5b6de120d1cc.jpg", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/logos/NCU_cd70d4f353eb9449f4ef5b6de120d1cc.jpg"}
