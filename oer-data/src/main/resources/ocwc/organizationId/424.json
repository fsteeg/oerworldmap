The history of the province of Cadiz is marked by the legacy of the diverse cultures that have passed through it: Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs,...\r\nIt is a unique province for the characteristics of its districts and for the population distribution around large urban centres.\r\nThe University of Cadiz is strongly linked to the territory in which develops its activity. For this it is divided into 4 campuses with a total of 64 degrees. \r\nDuring the last years a lot of work was done to face the ever rising demand for superior studies. The UCA has passed from having 6,000 students during the scholastic year 1979-1980 to almost 22,000 presently.", "logo_small": "", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/"}
