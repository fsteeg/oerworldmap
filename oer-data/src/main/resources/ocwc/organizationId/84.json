Inspired by the founder's independent mind, international spirit and Christian faith as well as his respect for the Western ideas of education at Phillips Academy and Amherst College, Doshisha University constantly promotes Christian morality, individual liberty, and international understanding. Doshisha University consists of nine faculties and eleven graduate schools, attended by approximately 25,000 students now.", "logo_small": "logos/doshisha_c1363fbbf145ac95056b6a329beeb953.jpg", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/logos/doshisha_c1363fbbf145ac95056b6a329beeb953.jpg"}
