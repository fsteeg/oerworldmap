Licensors have a wide range of options for choosing which permissions to grant and uses to allow.\r\n\r\nCreative Commons licenses incorporate a unique and innovative three-layer design. The first layer is the \u201clegal code,\u201d consisting of traditional legal tools applicable around the world. This is supplemented with a \u201chuman-readable\u201d explanation in more user-friendly language accessible to most creators. The final layer is a \u201cmachine-readable\u201d description that software systems, search engines and other technology can understand and use to make searching for and utilizing CC-licensed works more convenient.\r\n\r\nTaken together, the licenses' three layers ensure that the spectrum of rights covered by our tools isn\u2019t something only lawyers can understand. It\u2019s something that the creators of works can understand, their users can understand, and even the Web itself can understand.", "logo_small": "logos/cc-logo.gif", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/logos/cc-logo.gif"}
