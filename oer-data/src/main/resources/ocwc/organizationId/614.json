To match these high quality programs, we are blessed with outstanding students. The resulting combination sets SeoulTech apart from other major universities because we consistently rank at the top in full-time employment of graduates (top ranked for 4 consecutive years: 2009 \u2013 2012).  The underlying foundation which makes this all possible is our premier research and instructional faculty.  Our Professors are ranked 12th among around 200 Korean universities, in terms articles published in international journals per capita in 2012, according to the JoongAng Daily Newspaper", "logo_small": "", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/"}
