Its campus is 298 hectares. These make NPUST the biggest and the prettiest university in Taiwan. In the campus, green lawn is grown, various trees and flowers planted. Dormitories were designed and built under the concern of the height difference of the land. They look simple and dedicate. The campus is filled with elegance and wabi sabi, comparing to a nature park.
