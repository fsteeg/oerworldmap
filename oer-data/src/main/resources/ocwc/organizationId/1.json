With more than 40,000 students, it offers 650 courses in all major disciplines. Since its establishment in 1974 the OUI published over 500 academic titles, and prints over a million copies annually. These books constitute the largest and most comprehensive collection of university-level text-books in Israel, especially adapted to the needs of distant learners. The books and the accompanying course materials (study guides, assignments, audiovisual, multimedia and web-based) are delivered to OUI students and are used for self study. The university has a robust Hebrew-based home-grown LMS and it offers a rich variety of on-line learning models, including Web 2.0 applications. We use a hybrid (or blended) pedagogical model which combines distance a-synchronous tutoring with face-to-face sessions, some by video broadcasting to classrooms in study centers and to students' homes via their broadband web access.", "logo_small": "logos/LogoOpIsrael72_a4f7e5bfbbb2bb8b343957d424bfe6b4.jpg", "logo_small_url": "http://www.ocwconsortium.org/media/logos/LogoOpIsrael72_a4f7e5bfbbb2bb8b343957d424bfe6b4.jpg"}
