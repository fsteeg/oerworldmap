"673098","Achieve","Achieve is an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit education reform organization dedicated to working with states to raise academic standards and graduation requirements, improve assessments, and strengthen accountability. Created in 1996 by a bipartisan group of governors and business leaders, Achieve is leading the effort to make college and career readiness a priority across the country so that students graduating from high school are academically prepared for postsecondary success.

Information on Achieve's OER initiatives is available at http://www.achive.org/oer-rubrics.

To help states, districts, teachers, and other users determine the degree of alignment of OER to the Common Core State Standards, and to determine aspects of quality of OER, Achieve has developed eight rubrics in collaboration with leaders from the OER community (download link for rubrics below). To allow users to apply these rubrics and evaluate the quality of instructional resources, Achieve partnered with OER Commons to develop an online evaluation tool. OER Commons, an online repository for open education resources, is now hosting the tool and its resulting evaluation data. 

Building on this work, seven states—California, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, Washington, and Wisconsin—agreed to work together in Achieve’s OER Institute. The goal of OER Institute is to bring these states together to discuss issues and policy barriers surrounding using OER in college- and career-ready standards implementation. This ongoing, year-long effort has included webinars for states to discuss these issues, such as the use of open licensing and measures of quality, as well as an in-person convening in November 2012 for state teams to share current progress in using OER and engage in strategic planning activities to use OER in their transition to new standards. Below is the OER Planning Framework and presentation slides used as part of the November 2012 in-person convening. Achieve will be continuing this work through providing virtual and in-person convenings for OER Institute states, providing  state-specific assistance to implement plans related to OER and hosting OER materials review sessions.","http://www.achieve.org","","National","R","","","","[{""salutation"":""Mr."",""first_name"":""Hans"",""last_name"":""Voss"",""job_title"":""Policy Associate"",""email"":""hvoss@achieve.org"",""organization"":""Achieve"",""website"":""http:\/\/www.achieve.org\/oer-rubrics"",""street_address"":""1400 16th St. NW, Suite 510"",""city"":""Washington, DC"",""country"":""US""}]","Copyright",""

"673161","Encyclopedia of Life","The Encyclopedia of Life (EOL; www.eol.org) project is an unprecedented global partnership between the scientific community and the general public.  It constitutes a major effort to create an online reference and participatory website for all 1.9 million currently named and known species and those yet undiscovered organisms. Its mission is to increase awareness and understanding of living nature through an Encyclopedia of Life that gathers, generates and shares knowledge in an open, freely-accessible and trusted digital resource.  Anybody can register as an EOL member and add text, images, videos, comments or tags to EOL pages. Expert curators ensure quality of the core collection by authenticating materials submitted by diverse projects and individual contributors.   Learning and education activities (http://education.eol.org/) in formal and informal settings are a core focus of EOL to improve awareness and understanding of biodiversity globally.  Many of these activities include co-development and sharing of web-based educational tools and best practices that can also utilize the EOL platform for accessing vetted scientific information and sharing outcomes globally.



One of EOL\'s primary partners is the Biodiversity Heritage Library (http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/)  The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is a consortium of 12 natural history and botanical libraries that cooperate to digitize and make accessible the legacy literature of biodiversity held in their collections and to make that literature available for open access and responsible use as a part of a global â€œbiodiversity commons.â€



Both EOL and BHL have significant international participation.  EOL currently has seven international partners who are using the EOL information technology platform to organize and serve biodiversity information in their local languages.  The current international partners are located in Australia, the Arab region, China, Costa Rica (i.e., INBio), Mexico, South Africa and The Netherlands.  EOL is in discussions with other regional biodiversity centers around the world.  



Since 2009, the BHL has expanded globally. The European Commissionâ€™s eContentPlus program has recently funded the BHL-Europe project, with 28 institutions, to assemble the European language literature. Additionally, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Atlas of Living Australia, Brazil (through SciELO and BIREME), and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina have created regional BHL nodes. These projects will work together to share content, protocols, services, and digital preservation practices.","http://www.eol.org; http://education.eol.org/","mstuder@eol.org","Global","R","","","","[{""salutation"":""Dr"",""first_name"":""Marie"",""last_name"":""Studer"",""job_title"":""Learning and Education Director, Encyclopedia of Life"",""email"":""mstuder@eol.org"",""organization"":""Encyclopedia of Life"",""website"":""http:\/\/www.eol.org; http:\/\/education.eol.org\/"",""street_address"":""26 Oxford Street"",""city"":""Cambridge, (MA)"",""country"":""US""}]","Copyright",""

"673167","European Schoolnet","Since 2002 European Schoolnet (EUN) has engaged in a series of projects involving supporting Ministries of Education (MoE) aimed at building access to open digital learning resources.  Even as the Open Educational Resources movement was in its infancy (the term being coined in 2002), EUN in collaboration with European MoE and industry partners, engaged in research and development projects aimed at establishing systems and methods for distributing open learning resources available in national and regional educational repositories and in developing European quality standards for OER.  To make digital learning content interoperable and easily discoverable, EUN and its partners have particularly developed, tested, and deployed ‘brokerage system’ architectures and services in the course of successive European Comission sponsored projects.
Over the last ten years in a series of small and large-scale school validation pilot projects in Europe, EUN and partner MoEs have built, tested and managed platforms and portals dedicated to fostering communities of practice in sharing expertise, producing user generated resources and distributing open educational content produced by MoEs and other content providers (under a variety of open licenses, including Creative Commons). 
One of the best known and self-sustaining long term outcomes of this work funded in part by EC grants is European Schoolnet’s Learning Resource Exchange (LRE).  The Learning Resource Exchange is an infrastructure comprising a catalog of Open Educational Resources (currently there are more than 200,000 resources referenced in the catalog) representing more than 60 content providers.  The LRE is not a single portal.  Rather the LRE provides the ‘pipes’ to link Open Educational Resource content producers to OER content consumers by organizing, describing and re-distributing OER descriptions to any connected service (e.g., MoE national portals).  There are several steps in this process, all managed by the LRE service.  The LRE works behind the scenes collecting descriptions from providers with open content; this metadata is then fed and organized into the LRE catalog; the next step involves providing access to this catalog to other systems and platforms.","lreforschools.eun.org","info@eun.org","Global","R","wBVu2zxSs4s","","","[{""salutation"":""Dr."",""first_name"":""Elena"",""last_name"":""Shulman"",""job_title"":""Digital Content Expert"",""email"":""elena.shulman@eun.org"",""organization"":""European Schoolnet (EUN)"",""website"":""http:\/\/eun.org"",""street_address"":""Rue des Tr\u00e8ves 61"",""city"":""Brussels"",""country"":""BE""}]","CC BY NC",""

"831165","culturally authentic pictorial lexicon","Welcome to the Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon, CAPL, the source for authentic images for language learning. As a language teacher and learner, I always seek to connect language, culture, and meaning. This site represents my interest to not only write about language learning, but provide concrete examples.

Our world rich in diversity, both linguistic and visual, and often the connection between word and image can be lost. As commercial globalization brings the world together through 'common products', we sometimes forget how our visual perception of the world affects our use of words and the meanings they convey.

Is a house really a Haus, is pain really хлеб, and when we see red cabbage, is it really red? These are simple and mundane questions that underscore the fact that visual perception is culturally determined and visual cognition varies from culture to culture.

The CAPL project seeks to explore this idea through a collection of authentic photographs arranged by language and context. In the coming year, we will add more photos, more databases, and more textual descriptions. Check back often as we expand our collection.

It is our hope that the collection itself can spur research in a variety of areas and that the collection can be used by language teachers and learners throughout the world with its generous Creative Commons license.","http://capl.washjeff.edu/about.php","","Institutional","R","","","","[]","CC BY","Target areas|Youth"
